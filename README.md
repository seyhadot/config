# My minimal dotfiles

<!-- ![screenshot](screenshot.png) -->

Links to some stuff I use on my m1 mbp:
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/coc/start
  cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/coc/start
  git clone --branch release https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim.git --depth=1


### Where is my neovim config?
I have a pre-configured neovim setup called VapourNvim. You can find it [here](https://github.com/hackorum/VapourNvim/).
